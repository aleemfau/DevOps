# Lambda Function for Grafana Integration

  

This Lambda function is designed to interact with Grafana through its API. It performs several actions based on the provided requirements. Additionally, it logs requests in an AWS Timestream database and sends error messages to an SNS topic.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Before running the Lambda function, ensure that you have the following:

  

- AWS Account

- Grafana Instance

- IAM Role with the necessary permissions for Lambda function

- AWS Timestream database and table

- SNS Topic named "ERR_TOPIC"

  

## Dependencies

  

Make sure to install the required dependencies for the Lambda function:

  

- Python 3.11 or later (if not provided by AWS Lambda)

-  `boto3` library

-  `urllib3` library

  

Install the dependencies using the following:

  

`bash

pip  install  boto3  urllib3

  

## Configuration

  

Update  the  Lambda  function  code  with  your  specific  configurations:

  

-  **AWS  credentials (access key,  secret  key,  session  token)**

-  **Grafana  API  URL (`grafana_api_url`)**

-  **AWS  Timestream  configuration:**

-  Region (`region`)

-  Database  name (`database_name`)

-  Table  name (`table_name`)

-  **SNS  Topic  ARN (`ERR_TOPIC`)**

  

## Deployment

  

Deploy  the  Lambda  function  using  the  AWS  Lambda  console  or  AWS  CLI.  Ensure  that  the  Lambda  function  has  the  necessary  IAM  role  attached.

  

## Usage

  

1.  Invoke  the  Lambda  function  manually  or  set  up  an  AWS  API  Gateway  trigger.

  

2.  The  function  will  perform  the  following  actions:

  

-  Check  if  the  Grafana  organization  exists  based  on  the  provided  org  name.

-  Check  if  the  Grafana  user  exists  based  on  the  provided  email.  If  not,  create  the  user  with  the  role  "Viewer."

-  If  there  are  any  exceptions,  an  error  message  is  sent  to  the  specified  SNS  Topic.

-  Logs  of  requests  are  saved  in  the  Timestream  database.

  

## Additional Notes

  

-  Adjust  the  timeout  duration (`timeout_duration`) according to your requirements.
-  When  the  Grafana  server  is  not  responding,  we  will  get  a  timeout  error  after  3  seconds (default).

-  Ensure  that  the  Lambda  function  has  the  necessary  permissions  to  access  Grafana,  Timestream,  and  SNS.
